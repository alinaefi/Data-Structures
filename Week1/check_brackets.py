# python3

# Task. Your friend is making a text editor for programmers. He is currently working on a feature that will
# find errors in the usage of different types of brackets. Code can contain any brackets from the set
# []{}(), where the opening brackets are [,{, and ( and the closing brackets corresponding to them
# are ],}, and ).
# For convenience, the text editor should not only inform the user that there is an error in the usage
# of brackets, but also point to the exact place in the code with the problematic bracket. First priority
# is to find the first unmatched closing bracket which either doesnâ€™t have an opening bracket before it,
# like ] in ](), or closes the wrong opening bracket, like } in ()[}. If there are no such mistakes, then
# it should find the first unmatched opening bracket without the corresponding closing bracket after it,
# like ( in {}([]. If there are no mistakes, text editor should inform the user that the usage of brackets
# is correct.
# Apart from the brackets, code can contain big and small latin letters, digits and punctuation marks.
